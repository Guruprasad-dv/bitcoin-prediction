# 🚀 Bitcoin Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project predicts **Bitcoin (BTC) Closing Price** based on historical market data using **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**.  
It is developed as a part of machine learning practice and demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
