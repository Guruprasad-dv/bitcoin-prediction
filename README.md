 # Bitcoin Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project predicts **Bitcoin (BTC) Closing Price** based on historical market data using **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**.  
It is developed as a part of machine learning practice and demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.



# Project Overview

| Attribute | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Algorithm | Multiple Linear Regression |
| Language | Python |
| Libraries | Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib |
| Input | Historical Bitcoin price dataset |
| Output | Predicted future closing price |



 # How It Works
1. Load Bitcoin historical dataset  
2. Prepare and preprocess data  
3. Train the Multiple Linear Regression model  
4. Evaluate performance using metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)  
5. Compare actual vs predicted BTC prices 

 # Results

The model shows a strong correlation between prediction and actual price during


# Evaluation:0.78
